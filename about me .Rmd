I am a second-year Master of Public Health (MPH) student at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, in the department of Population & Family Health. I am specializing in Public Health Research Methods and am passionate about using data to improve sexual and reproductive health equity. I am currently a research assistant for the Averting Maternal Death and Disability Program, where I am assisting on a project to revise and rethink the Monitoring EmONC Handbook: a global resource for monitoring health systems' ability to provide emergency obstetric and newborn care.


I currently live in Manhattan, but I'm a proud Canadian from just outside of Toronto. In my free time, you can usually find me baking for friends and it's basically my life goal to be in the Great Canadian Baking Show.
